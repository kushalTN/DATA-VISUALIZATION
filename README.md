# DATA-VISUALIZATION
Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I recently worked on a data visualization mini-project using Python, where I explored a dataset of the highest-grossing Hollywood movies. The goal was to understand trends like which movies made the most money, how budgets relate to earnings, and how things like license ratings and running time vary across films.
